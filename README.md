# OrderedList-Operations

This project is a Java application that demonstrates operations on ordered lists created from a file of random names. Users specify the size of two lists, and the program generates these lists with unique names, allowing for operations such as merging, finding common elements, and finding differences between the two lists. The results of each operation are saved to text files.

## Features

- **Generate Ordered Lists**: Create two ordered lists of unique names from a provided file of random names.
- **Merge Operation**: Combine two ordered lists into one merged list.
- **Common Elements**: Find and display common names between the two lists.
- **Difference**: List names that are in the first list but not in the second.
- **File Output**: Save each resulting list to a separate text file (`merged.txt`, `common.txt`, and `difference.txt`).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- A file named `RandomNames.txt` in the root directory containing the list of names, with each name on a new line.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaafiaTroodon/OrderedList-Operations.git
